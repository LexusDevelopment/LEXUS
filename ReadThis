==LEXUS==

LEXUS Development is a team that belongs to these ROBLOX members:

12packkid (Samuel)
Slappy826 (Unknown #1)
Diitto (William)
Bomblover (Unknown #2)
Nexure (Jack)

All of us share all of the same rights to this, if this ever gets leaked, use it. But beware, we will have security features on standby, you've been warned.

This script's creation was made as we thought TITAN (belongs to William) got leaked. So me (Sam) and Slappy826 made LEXUS. Then, while talking on Skype, William, Bomblover and Jack joined in and added commands.
All of us are now developers, but me (Sam) and Slappy826 are head developers.

You can now proceed to LEXUS Admin if you wish.
